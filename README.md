# Movie Revenue Prediction - School Project

This project was a part of a school assignment where the objective was to apply machine learning techniques to predict a movie's revenue in the USA.

## Project Overview

The project involved several key steps and concepts, including:

### Data Cleaning:
- Dealing with NaN values.
- Handling categorical features.
- Using embeddings.
- Removing outliers.

### Feature Selection:
- Identifying and selecting the most relevant features for the model.

### Model Definition and Evaluation:
We defined and evaluated multiple regression models to predict movie revenue, such as:
- **LinearRegression**
- **RandomForestRegressor**
- **MLPRegressor**
- **KNeighborsRegressor**

The performance of each model was assessed based on the quality of the predictions and their ability to generalize to new data.
